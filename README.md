# 3D Sound Sample By OpenAL

This software allows you to experience stereophonic technology.   
The program is based on OpenAL.  
  
The application is executed with the following command:  
`python main.py`  
Or you can run it as an exe file in the dist folder. (The process is quite slow in this case).　　
  
The sound sources can be freely placed in the 3D space using the GUI.  
A button that allows the sound source to rotate around the user is also implemented.
